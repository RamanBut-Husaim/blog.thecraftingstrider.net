**My name is Raman But-Husaim and I am a professional software engineer and the author of {{< slink src="https://dotnetweekly.gitbook.io/weekly/" title="DotNet Weekly Series" class="emph" >}}.**

I've started to play with programming languages in 2009 and since than the interest to computer science has grown stronger. With love to my chosen one, family, music, literature, education and teaching and passion to functional programming, distributed systems and software engineering in general.
