Though I have a MacBook PRO 13' that I'm using mostly to read articles and perform small dev tasks my main working machine is Intel Core I7-based desktop with two OSes installed - Windows 10 (for entertainment) and OpenSUSE as a core dev machine. I find OpenSUSE an amazing and quite stable distribution however from time to time I'm facing issues with it as well.
